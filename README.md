# Picturepark Microsite SDK Samples
Microsites are single or collections of web pages which are integrated within larger websites or online portals, or provided stand-alone. Microsites complement other online premises with purpose-specific content and functionality, often targeting specific audiences.

A Picturepark Microsite pulls content from the [Picturepark Content Platform](https://picturepark.com/software/), where content authorities manage the material, e.g., metadata, taxonomy, semantics, permissions. Editors make content available using distribution channels, query filters, or permissions without having to manually copy between systems, aka [headless content management](https://picturepark.com/solutions/headless-content-management).

Microsites can be static, always displaying the same content, or they can be dynamic, in which the content can differ based on rules, metadata filter definitions, or user search queries.

## Content Portal
The Content Portal enables those browsing publically to easily navigate and find guidance through a variety of content via both filters and a powerful search. Content Portal users can examine thumbnails or other previews of content, which they can additionally choose to download in a range of formats and image resolutions. It is an excellent publication end-point within a wider [headless](https://picturepark.com/solutions/headless-content-management) workflow.
