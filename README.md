# Picturepark Microsite SDK Samples

Microsites are single or collections of web pages which are integrated within larger websites or online portals, or provided stand-alone. Microsites complement other online premises with purpose-specific content and functionality, often targeting specific audiences. 

A Picturepark Microsite pulls content from the [Picturepark Content Platform](https://picturepark.com/software/), where the content is managed e.g. metadata, taxonomy, semantics, permissions. Using distribution channels, query filters and/or permissions content is made available without having to be manually copied between systems aka [headless content management](https://picturepark.com/solutions/headless-content-management). 

Microsites can be static, in which the same content is displayed always, or they can be dynamic, in which the content can differ based on rules, metadata filter definitions or user search queries.

## Content Portal
The Content Portal enables those browsing publically to easily navigate and be guided through a variety of content via both filter facets and a powerful search. Content Portal users can examine thumbnails or other previews of content; which they can they additionally choose to download in a range of formats and image resolutions. It is a great publication end-point within a wider [headless](https://picturepark.com/solutions/headless-content-management) workflow.
